# ~~Home~~
### ~~Set "John P Correia on the top left of navbar to lead back to Home~~
### ~~Display GIFs of projects [games, webapps, PM projects]~~
### ~~honestly I would have those gifs of your game as close to front and center as possible. Maybe on the home page a short about section~~
### ~~“My name is John and I’m a software engineer hobbyist turning professional. I love building games (C#, Unity), but can build about anything (JS, React, Python, C, Node, Express, etc.)”~~
### ~~Remove button in nav and move everything to Contact section~~

# About Me
### Change descriptions to talk more about being a developer than being in customer service
```
I would work on your “about” quite a bit. 
It’s not punchy enough and 
I’m not sure how relevant it is that you’ve been in customer service and theme parks for eight years, 
or that you enjoyed the experience.

You want something that really says 
  “I was destined to be a web developer”
```

# Projects
### Think about a different card/container for games to show off website as gifs
### Should say "Q and W to rotate"
### Display GIFs of projects [games, webapps, PM projects]
### Add more gifs of my projects
```
On the cards for your projects, 
this is a nice-to-have, 
but I would include a photo of the project itself 
maybe choose a different card type for the material design, 
mostly because your games are beautiful

oh my gosh @John C. this gif on your “hobbies” is AMAZING
Create one of those for all of your games and put it in the projects section!!!!!!!

small thing - on your tetris game “z” to rotate doesn’t work
```
